Trip Planner Walkthrough

I like including walkthrough's but not only because they are required but because they help my train of thought. I also think they're a great place to go back to once you've learned and improved from where you were once at.

For the Rails Assessment project at Flatiron's Learn full stack web development program, I decided to build an application called "Trip Planner". This was one of the ideas I thought of while brainstorming including a bucket list. I've planned trips in the past and I'm actually in the process of planning one now. I figured why not create an application based on the functionality I think would be cool to have.

Once I had the idea down I found it somewhat tricky to figure out the proper associations. After writing a tasklist with models and controllers along with everything else the app required, I had a better plan for taking down the deliverables. I also asked a learn expert to provide some suggestions and we reviewed the associations I had in mind, I was ready to go.

I wrote down the requirements for the project such as the models and their attributes along with associations. I included the controllers I would probably use and views. I knew I wanted to include some form of authentication and thought of using devise because that'd be perfect. I even thought that maybe I could include omniauth for this project.
